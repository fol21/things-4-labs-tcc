In the verge of the data revolution, a growing interest in communication sytems between machines and the sharing systems of telemetric data on devices rises, whether in a factory or in a residence. This work presents a system for Internet applications of things (IoT) using MQTT, an application protocol for communication between devices that shares telemetri data . It is the \textit{língua franca} for publishing telemetric data via TCP / IP, with data persistion using MongoDB. The system will  encompass all sectors of data acquisition to the application layer in consoles, facilitating implementations of applications in each scenario.
